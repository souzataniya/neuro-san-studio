    Tests for AgentNetworkDefinitionMiddleware.

    Covers _resolve_hocon_path (synchronous path resolution) and the abefore_model hook's
    hand-off of a loaded network's metadata block (issue #1398). The designer is stateless:
    the client owns the network's top-level "metadata" block and sends it back under
    AGENT_NETWORK_METADATA. A network the hook loads from a HOCON file or an S3 reservation
    must therefore leave that network's sanitized block under the key, replacing whatever the
    client sent, while a definition passed directly or a failed load must not touch the key.

    A load whose "tools" yields no usable agent is a failed load, not a silent no-op, and the
    S3 path sets AGENT_NETWORK_NAME only when a definition was loaded, like the HOCON path
    always did (issue #1426); the tests for both are here as well.

    Also covers the error each branch of _hocon_to_config reports for a file that cannot be
    loaded (issue #1440): a parse or substitution failure, an unsupported or upper-case
    extension, an unreadable path and a missing file, driven through the real restorer, plus
    the hook's hand-off of that error to the client.
